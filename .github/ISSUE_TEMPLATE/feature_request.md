The Highwind assets that have pagination aren't arranged in the order they were created instead some assets were created recently on the first page.

Paginate the Highwind assets based on the date they were created.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Navigating to an asset I am looking for manually based on the date.

**Additional context**

Comparing the two snapshots you realize there is an asset that is on the fourth page for June 06-23 yet it should probably be on the first page.
